# Welcome to Astro Map

Astro Map shows a projection of the moonâ€™s shadow on the Earth for any solar eclipse within a 200 year range by using data supplied from NASA's public websites.

You can checkout the backend server for this app [here](https://github.com/AliCW/Astro-map-BE/tree/main).

## Description

The frontend has been implemented using React Native with Expo to create a mobile application. Material Dark theme is asserted by an UI library called [React Native Paper](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/index.html) while [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) is used for switching tabs with fluid animation.

For the design of the application, [react-native-snap-carousel](https://github.com/meliorence/react-native-snap-carousel) gives the ability to scroll cards on homepage horizontally. The map view is provided by [react-native-maps](https://github.com/react-native-maps/react-native-maps).

## Minimum development requirement

1. Node.js v18 or above
2. React v18 or above
3. React Native v0.70 or above
4. Expo v47.0 or above
